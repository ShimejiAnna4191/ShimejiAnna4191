## Hello my friend, I'm Anna!

I am 15 years old and a student in high school

I like to do things that I like, well at least now because I have finished all my exams and now I have quite a lot of free time
I also quite enjoy content about anime, music and games, sometimes I also like artwork and reading fanfic 

I'm also quite interested in computer science and want to play around and make things around it, that why I decided to go to github

I have a dream of becoming a content creator as a writer

### Some fact about me      
Actually my name is not Anna but I will keep this name for some reasons related to motivation and good sleep            

I have the personality of a kid, well bc i'm a kid

Sometimes I'm curious so don't be shy if I ask too many questions

I disagree with chatGPT, well I just consider it as a search engine
